# RevenueMagnetML

Opportunity Prediction as the primary use case. This involves predicting the likelihood of an opportunity closing successfully. It's a valuable scenario for sales teams to prioritize efforts and allocate resources effectively

### Business Impact:

Predicting the success of an opportunity directly impacts revenue and business growth.
It helps in concentrating efforts on opportunities with a higher probability of success, optimizing resource utilization.
Complexity and Challenge:

Predicting whether an opportunity will close successfully is a challenging task, requiring a sophisticated ML model.
It involves handling both numerical and categorical features, as well as dealing with imbalanced classes (more closed-lost opportunities than closed-won).
Decision Support for Sales Teams:

The model's predictions can serve as decision support for sales teams, guiding them on which opportunities to prioritize.
It enhances the efficiency of the sales process by focusing on high-potential opportunities.
Feature Importance Analysis:

Opportunity prediction models often provide insights into which features are most influential in the closing decision.
Understanding these factors can inform strategic decisions and marketing efforts.
Model Evaluation Challenges:

Evaluating the model's performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score adds complexity to the project, making it more advanced.
Handling potential class imbalances requires careful consideration.
For the technical aspects, you would likely employ advanced techniques such as ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) or even explore more sophisticated models like neural networks. Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning will play crucial roles in optimizing model performance.

## Set up your Environment


### **`macOS`** type the following commands : 

- For installing the virtual environment you can either use the [Makefile](Makefile) and run `make setup` or install it manually with the following commands:

     ```BASH
    make setup
    ```
    After that active your environment by following commands:
    ```BASH
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
Or ....
- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands:

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
### **`WindowsOS`** type the following commands :

- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands.

   For `PowerShell` CLI :

    ```PowerShell
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For `Git-bash` CLI :
    ```
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **`Note:`**
    If you encounter an error when trying to run `pip install --upgrade pip`, try using the following command:
    ```Bash
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

    ### **`Linux Users`**  : You know what to do :sunglasses:
